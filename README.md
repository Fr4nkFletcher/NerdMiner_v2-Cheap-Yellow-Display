I couldn't get the webflasher at https://flasher.bitronics.store/ to work and had to use spacehuhn's web tool. This required uploading all four files and setting the appropriate offset at which they're flashed. I just wanted to make it a little easier so I made this. 

## Install instructions

Visit the [webflasher](https://fr4nkfletcher.github.io/NerdMiner_v2-Cheap-Yellow-Display/flash.html) and click Connect

## NerdMiner configuration

After flashing, you will only need to setup your Wifi and BTC address.

Note: when BTC address of your selected wallet is not provided, mining will not be started.

#### Wifi Accesspoint


1. Connect to NerdMinerAP
   - AP: NerdMinerAP
   - PASS: MineYourCoins
1. Set up your Wifi Network
1. Add your BTC address
1. Change the password if needed

   - If you are using public-pool.io and you want to set a custom name to your worker you can append a string with format _.yourworkername_ to the address

### Buttons

- One click > change screen.
